  "full_description": "ResNet-152 is a deep residual neural network with 152 layers, designed for image classification tasks. It was developed by Microsoft Research and introduced in the paper 'Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition'. ResNet-152 achieved state-of-the-art performance in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) by addressing the vanishing gradient problem through residual connections, enabling the training of very deep networks.",
