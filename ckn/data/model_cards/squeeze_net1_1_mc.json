  "full_description": "SqueezeNet1_1 is a lightweight convolutional neural network architecture designed for image classification tasks. It achieves comparable accuracy to larger models like AlexNet while significantly reducing the number of parameters, making it ideal for deployment on devices with limited computational resources. SqueezeNet1_1 employs fire modules, which consist of squeeze and expand layers, to maintain high efficiency without compromising performance.",
